fancy_desc: How many frames do we need to remember someone or someplace? Most people only really need one, so I divide the day into sections - getting ready, the ceremony etc, and I try to create one image which inspires me for every section, which just defines that moment

            <p><strong>NnBRAND</strong> Our friends referred NnBRAND for our wedding and we are SO HAPPY they did. From day one and throughout our whole 2 year engagement, they were very helpful, supportive and always went out of their way for us. We connected with them right from the start. Not to mention, their pictures are the best I have seen. They really knew how to capture our big day. Our friends and family were raving about how amazing his pictures were, starting the night of the wedding. We had a few of our pictures the night of available and then our photo album, full gallery of photos and wedding video was up the week after the wedding. We are so happy Andonoff and NnBRAND were apart of our wedding day!</p>
            <p><strong>Andonoff</strong> We were very fortunate to work with Andonoff as well as his assistant NnBRAND on our wedding day in July! I cannot say enough positive remarks about this duo as they captured the entire day from start to finish within pictures and video! Thanks to Andonoff and NnBRAND we now can relive our special day by viewing our My Life Fusion video! Our guests were simply amazed by their work which was presented during the reception! There were smiles, laughter, and tears that moved throughout the ballroom while watching this video! Andonoff worked very closely with my husband and I in the early planning process, but was considered to be part of the bridal party on the actual wedding day as he took the time to get to know each and every bridal party member. He cracked jokes throughout shooting, but also got the job done in a timely manner! The quality of Andonoff's work is impeccable as I have fallen in love with every single picture that was taken! I highly recommend Andonoff Photography for capturing your special day!</p>
            <p><strong>NnBRAND</strong> I cannot say enough good things about Andonoff. He took a group of people who had no idea what they were doing and created hundreds of amazing pictures. It's hard to chose our favorites! He was so much fun to work with, both for the engagement photos and wedding day. We had a relatively inexpensive wedding, but the one thing I invested in was the photos. Worth. Every. Penny. Thank you!</p>
